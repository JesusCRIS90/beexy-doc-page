GPT, the CSS Properties are not applied.

I show you an Image.

Now, the CSS Property that I pass to the component is appear but it is not applied. The defaults properties from the components are not applied.

```CSS
.center-layout{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

As you can see on the Image the Component => bee-center-layout tag appear both classes (bee-center-layout-page center-layout)
